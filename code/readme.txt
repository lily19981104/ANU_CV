Note: All the codes are using Jupyter notebook.

Operations about Jupyter notebook please refer to: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook

All the deep learning models are based on the existing framework Keras-tensorflow, to train the network, you need to firstly set up the correct environment. Please refer to:

Important: The code for generating dataset for detector please refer to: https://github.com/penny4860/SVHN-deep-digit-detector
Many thanks to what he has done.

If you only focus on the final results about recognizing digits, you may only needs to run MSER.ipynb file as the 2 trained models are in the directory.

You can test different images in Evaluation part by changing the image path.
